    <h1>Basic Shapes</h1>
    <p>Basic shapes are the building blocks of a website. They are used to create the structure of a website. Let's look at the canvas below as the beginning to working with shapes</p>

    <canvas width="600" height="600"></canvas>

    <script>
        // Begin by grabbing a reference to the canvas
        // and its context in 2D
        let canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
        let context = canvas.getContext('2d');

        /**
         * Create a blue-filled rectangle:
         * 
         * Define the style for your context first to use blue fill color.
         * Next create a filled rectangle by using the shortcut "fillRect" method from context
         */
        context.fillStyle = 'blue';
        context.fillRect(100, 100, 400, 400);
