    <h1>Basic Shapes</h1>
    <p>Basic shapes are the building blocks of a website. They are used to create the structure of a website. Let's look at the canvas below as the beginning to working with shapes</p>

    <canvas width="600" height="600"></canvas>

    <script>
        // Begin by grabbing a reference to the canvas
        // and its context in 2D
        let canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
        let context = canvas.getContext('2d');

        /**
         * Create a blue-filled rectangle:
         * 
         * Define the style for your context first to use blue fill color.
         * Next create a filled rectangle by using the shortcut "fillRect" method from context
         */
        context.fillStyle = 'blue';
        context.fillRect(100, 100, 400, 400);

        /**
         * Create a outlined rectangle:
         * 
         * While the previous method was a shortcut for a recipe of
         * creating a blue filled rectange in particular, we can use
         * "rect" instead to clearly define and structure a more
         * customized rectangle.
         * 
         * Define the line width, begin drawing the path, draw a
         * rectangle just like before and only apply a stroke of
         * line width 4 as defined earlier.
         */ 
        context.lineWidth = 4;
        context.beginPath();
        context.rect(100, 100, 400, 400);
        context.stroke();

        /**
         * Create a outlined circle:
         * 
         * We can use a full 360 degrees/2 pie arc to create a circle.
         * And then apply stroke to it to have our desired output.
         */
        context.beginPath();
        context.arc(300, 300, 100, 0, Math.PI * 2);
        context.stroke();
